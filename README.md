Core-ng: A functioning core rewrite written in Angular 6.
---
This is a web app that interacts with [EPHS Core API](https://github.com/ephs/coreAP)

Forgive any jank core. I'm not that experienced with Angular.

Make sure you change the authentication.service.ts file to point to your API endpoint.

Based on [Core demo](https://github.com/ephs/core). Thanks [@eduxstad](https://github.com/eduxstad) and [@Jythonscript](https://github.com/Jythonscript)!
